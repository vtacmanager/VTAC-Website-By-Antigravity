    <h1>SECURITY STATEMENT</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: February 28, 2026</strong></p>

    <section>
        <h2>1. INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY</h2>
        <p><strong>Cloud Infrastructure:</strong> VTAC MANAGER is built on top of world-class infrastructure provided by
            <strong>Vercel</strong> and <strong>Supabase (AWS)</strong>. Our providers maintain industry-leading
            certifications, including <strong>SOC 2 Type II</strong> and <strong>ISO 27001</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>Physical Security:</strong> All data is stored in Tier III or Tier IV data centers featuring 24/7
            onsite security, biometric access control, and advanced environmental monitoring. We utilize the
            <strong>United Kingdom</strong> and <strong>United States</strong> regions for primary hosting and
            redundancy.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>2. DATA ENCRYPTION</h2>
        <p><strong>In Transit:</strong> All communications between your devices and our platform are encrypted using
            <strong>TLS 1.2 or higher</strong>. This ensures that your tactical data, player information, and login
            credentials cannot be intercepted by third parties.</p>
        <p><strong>At Rest:</strong> Our databases and disk storage are encrypted using <strong>AES-256</strong>, the
            global standard for industrial-grade data protection. This means that even in the event of physical hardware
            theft, your data remains unreadable.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. AUTHENTICATION & ACCESS CONTROL</h2>
        <p><strong>Supabase Auth:</strong> We use advanced authentication systems to manage user identities. Passwords
            are never stored in plain text; they are hashed using secure cryptographic algorithms to prevent
            unauthorized reconstruction.</p>
        <p><strong>Role-Based Security:</strong> We implement <strong>Row-Level Security (RLS)</strong> at the database
            level. This ensures that a coach from Team A can never access the tactical data or player CVs of Team B,
            even if a software bug exists in the application layer.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. RELIABILITY & BACKUPS</h2>
        <p><strong>Service Redundancy:</strong> Our application is deployed across a global edge network, ensuring high
            availability and protection against DDoS attacks. Core services target a <strong>99.9% uptime</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>Automatic Backups:</strong> We perform automated daily backups of all database content. These backups
            are stored in geographically separate locations to ensure that your tactical library and team history are
            safe even in catastrophic disaster scenarios.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. PAYMENTS SECURITY</h2>
        <p><strong>PCI Compliance:</strong> VTAC SOLUTIONS LTD does not store your credit card information on our
            servers. All financial transactions are handled by PCI-compliant payment gateways such as
            <strong>Stripe</strong> or <strong>PayPal</strong>. They manage the complex security requirements of the
            payment card industry on our behalf.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6. VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT</h2>
