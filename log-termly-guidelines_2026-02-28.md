## 📋 Termly Configuration Q&A

### Q1: Can I use Termly for Terms & Conditions and is it free?
**A:** Yes, you can use the **Termly Free Plan ($0/month)**. It allows you to generate one basic legal policy. It is perfect for the current development phase of VTAC. 
- *Note:* The free plan includes the Termly logo and has limited edits, but we can extract the HTML to match our site design.

### Q2: Is VTAC a Website or a Mobile App? (Platform Type)
**A:** Select **Website**. 
- *Reasoning:* Although VTAC uses mobile devices as controllers, it does so via the web browser ("No APPS, No FRICTION"). It is not a native app downloaded from the App Store.

### Q3: What type of platform is it? (SaaS vs Ecommerce)
**A:** Select **SaaS (Software as a Service)**.
- *Reasoning:* VTAC is a platform providing management and tactical training services via a subscription model (Monthly/Annual billing), which is the definition of a SaaS product.
