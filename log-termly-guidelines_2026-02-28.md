## 📋 Specific Question-by-Question Guidance

### 1. Platform Type & Usage
*   **Question:** Is your platform a website and/or mobile app?
*   **Answer:** **Website**
*   **Reasoning:** Although VTAC uses mobile devices as interactive controllers, it does so via a mobile browser (Web-based). There is no native app to download from an app store ("No Apps, No Friction"), so the "Website" category is the most accurate for legal terms.

### 2. Business Category
*   **Question:** What type of platform is it?
*   **Answer:** **SaaS (Software as a Service)**
*   **Reasoning:** VTAC is a platform providing team management and tactical training services via a membership/subscription model. It fits the SaaS definition perfectly compared to a simple blog or a physical marketplace.

### 3. Online Payments (Critical for Future-Proofing)
*   **Question:** "Does your website/app accept payments online?" (เว็บไซต์/แอปของคุณรับชำระเงินออนไลน์ไหม?)
*   **Answer:** **Yes**
*   **Detailed Reasoning:**
    *   **Future Strategy:** Even though current users primarily "Book a Demo," the ultimate business model is selling Subscriptions to coaches and academies via credit card.
    *   **Efficiency:** Setting this to "Yes" now prevents having to re-edit and re-generate the legal documents when the payment gateway (Pricing plans) goes live.
    *   **Legal Compliance:** Termly will generate sections explaining how payment data is handled. Note that VTAC won't store credit card numbers directly; they will be processed by a trusted Third-Party Gateway (like Stripe or PayPal). Having this in the document from day one ensures full financial legal compliance.

### 4. User Location (Globalization)
*   **Question:** Do you have users in the EU, UK, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway?
*   **Answer:** **Yes**
*   **Reasoning:** VTAC headquarters is in **Leicester, UK**. By default, you have UK users. Answering "Yes" ensures the policy includes mandatory GDPR and UK-GDPR compliance language.

*   **Question:** Do you have users in the United States?
*   **Answer:** **Yes**
*   **Reasoning:** We have already implemented an **en-US (US English)** localization for the website. This clearly indicates intent to serve the US market. Answering "Yes" will include necessary disclosures for US State-level privacy laws (like CCPA).

### 5. Hosting (Infrastructure Connectivity)
*   **Question:** Which country is your platform hosted in?
*   **Answer:** **United Kingdom**
*   **Reasoning:** Since VTAC's legal and physical operation is based in **Leicester, UK**, designating the UK as the primary hosting jurisdiction aligns with your UK-GDPR compliance and local operations.

*   **Question:** Is your platform hosted in any other country?
*   **Answer:** **Yes** (Add: **United States**)
*   **Reasoning:** Your website uses **Vercel** (Edge network) and **Supabase** (Cloud Database), both of which utilize global infrastructures primarily centered in the US (AWS). Disclosing this "Cross-border" processing is a mandatory legal requirement for international data transfers.

### 6. Use and Description (Scope of Purpose)
*   **Question:** Do you want to include a description about your website and/or app?
*   **Answer:** **Yes**
*   **Recommendation Description:** "VTAC MANAGER provides an integrated digital ecosystem for sports team management and interactive tactical training sessions."
*   **Reasoning:** Providing a clear description defines the scope of the service provided, which is essential for limiting liability in terms and conditions.

*   **Question:** Are your products for your users' personal and/or internal business use?
*   **Answer:** **Both**
*   **Reasoning:** VTAC serves both **Independent Coaches** (Personal use for their teams) and **Large Organizations/Schools** (Internal business use for managing multiple squads). Selecting both ensures the terms apply correctly to both individual and corporate users.
